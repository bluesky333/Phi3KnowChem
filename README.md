# Phi3KnowChem
Submission to the L+M-24 shared task at ACL2024 Language + Molecule Workshop.
We trained Phi-3-mini-4k for the molecule captioning task.
Our work shows that the continued pretraining phase without direct exposure to SMILES representations significantly enhanced the model's performance, a 300\% increase for the BLEU scores.
